# Notes on test_dir

After executing `addtypes`, this directory will contain all of the
file types that are recognized by the function `ctt_dir_walk()`
using SYS_getdents.

Along with `show_colors` that iteratively shows the available
standard console colors, you can set colors to use for each file
type.
